The files contained within this directory are meant to be downloaded and placed within an OpenComputers floppy disk, with the following structure:
/ - .install
  - reactor-listener.lua
  - reactor.cfg
  - reactor.lua
  - README (this file)

Once the directory structure matches, you should be able to install the script via "install <label>" where <label> is the label or directory path of the inserted floppy disk.

Once installation is complete, you should have the following prepared:
A computer with a
1. Wireless card of appropriate tier
2. Attached adapter and power battery / storage unit
3. Internet card (for downloading the scripts)
A microcontroller with a
1. Wireless card of appropriate tier
2. Redstone card i think
3. EEPROM with installed reactor-listener.lua script (don't forget before making the microcontroller, this goes inside!)

TODO make the side of the MC which emits redstone configurable via config library
